# PyText2SpeechProject
Python project for implementing txt2speech from website, pdf or txt files. Motive: I don't like reading, I like listening :)

NOTE: This project is still ongoing. Use at your own risk!

## SETUP/INSTALATION STEPS DEV ENV:    

**TODO**, but python-env is for sure used for the env. *requirements.txt* used for dependencies.

## INFO TOOLS:  

Python version: 3.12.0  


## PLAN:  
**1:** Find a good txt2speech model with a voice that is as natural and soothing as possible to listen to.  
**2:** Look out for tools to extract txt from pdf files. Add option to pass page range from which to extract txt. Keep footer and header info of pdf page in mind as that would lead to extraction of page numbers and other irrelevant txt in a page (is this even problematic? if so, how can we solve it? Brainstormed ideas: use regex to discard them, add option to remove header/footer txt if possible, this is all I have for now!!! )  
**3:** Structure of code has to be modular for readability and ease of change/modifications to the code. Use OOP.
